## Description

I will be building Snake utilizing HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This project will be be featured on my professional portfolio.

**Project Outline**:
- [ ] First I will do research on similar projects and learn from the successes and mistakes made by other developers.
- [ ] This game set up seems similar to how the grid in the tic tac toe assignment was built so I think I can borrow some elements from that project to start the general game board.
- [ ] I will then learn how to get a red dot to randonmly appear somwhere on the map. A test could be done where I could utilise an event listener and click the red dot and see where it appears next.
- [ ] Then I will need to learn how to build a controllable object using javascript. Initially I will try to get the snake tyo resond to commands sent by my arrow keys, but if that proves too dificult I could also look into building on screen buttons to control the snake.
- [ ] Next I would need to add some sort of event that occurs when the snake reaches the red dot. This event would make the snake longer and make another red dot appear somewhere on the map at random.
- [ ] I would also like the game to keep track of the score and give the user the option to restart the game without refreshing the webpage.
- [ ] After the functionaltiy of the game is complete, my remaining efforts will be spent designing the aesthetic of the game into something that I can confidently show a potential future employer.
